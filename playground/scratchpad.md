# Scratchpad - A document to keep my thoughts and ideas in a structured manner

## Brainstorming

1. [X] Add exact requirements for the project as its easy to miss details when project grows
2. [X] Check if there is anything needed from the frontend that needs to be integrated into the backend that its not mentioned in Christians backend notes
3. [ ] To kick-off the project, lets just get up a webserver to run that answers PONG to a PING or something like that. Better start small so can debug along the way

## Major decisions and why i took them

1. [ ] Lets try to implement all additional features - Christian mentioned **atleast 1** but lets be ambitious
2. [ ] Implement small webserver just to get something up and running and take it from there
